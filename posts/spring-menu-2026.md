After a long winter, we're thrilled to bring back the flavors of the season. Our spring menu features fresh locally-sourced vegetables, lighter mezze spreads, and a few new dishes Koby has been perfecting since January.

Spring in the Poconos is something special — and we try to reflect that in every plate. You'll notice lighter flavors, brighter colors, and a few ingredients you might not expect from a Mediterranean kitchen. That's the fun part.

## What's New This Season

We worked with a few farms in Monroe County to bring in produce that's genuinely local and genuinely fresh. Here's a look at what's coming to the menu:

- **Spring Mezze Board** — rotating seasonal dips, fresh pita, and house-pickled vegetables
- **Grilled Asparagus with Labneh** — charred asparagus, whipped labneh, za'atar oil
- **Market Fish of the Week** — changes weekly based on what's fresh
- **Strawberry & Mint Lemonade** — housemade, BYOB-friendly

## The Terrace Is Open

If you haven't dined outside yet, spring is the time. The creek is running, the trees are filling in, and there's nothing quite like dinner on the terrace as the sun goes down over the ridge. Reserve early — weekend tables fill up fast once the weather turns.

We're grateful for every guest who made this past winter one of our best yet. Looking forward to seeing you creekside this season.
