It's our favorite time of year: the terrace is open, the creek is running, and the Poconos are waking back up.

We opened the outdoor terrace this week and already the weekend reservations are filling in fast. If you've been waiting for the right moment to try us — or you're a regular who's been cooped up inside all winter — now is the time.

## What to Expect Outside

The terrace seats about 30 guests with views of the creek and the ridge beyond. We run the full dinner menu outside, plus a couple of terrace-only specials when the weather cooperates.

A few things to know:

- **Reservations strongly recommended** for weekends, especially after 6 PM
- **Walk-ins** are welcome on weeknights, usually no wait before 5:30
- **BYOB** is always welcome — we have glasses and a bucket
- **Weather policy** — if it's raining, we'll move you inside; the inside dining room is just as cozy

## Best Time to Come

Golden hour on a Friday is hard to beat. The light hits the creek just right around 6:30–7 PM, and the energy in the dining room picks up. If you want that specific table by the railing, book early — it goes first every time.

Looking forward to seeing you out there.
