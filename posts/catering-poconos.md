We've been quietly catering events across the Poconos for years — weddings, rehearsal dinners, corporate retreats, milestone birthdays. The feedback is always the same: guests can't believe food this good came from off-site.

That's the goal. We want your guests asking "who catered this?" not "is this catered?"

## What We Do

Every catering order is built from the same kitchen as our restaurant menu. We don't have a "catering menu" that's a watered-down version of the real thing — it's the same dishes, the same recipes, the same quality.

Popular options include:

- **Mediterranean mezze spreads** — perfect for cocktail hours and receptions
- **Family-style dinner service** — ideal for 20–100 guests
- **Shakshuka & brunch stations** — great for morning events and brunches
- **Custom menus** — built around dietary needs and event themes

## Who It's For

We've done events at resorts, private homes, event barns, and corporate campuses throughout Monroe County. If you're planning something in the Poconos and want food that leaves an impression, let's talk.

Reach out through our website or give us a call to discuss your event. We typically book out a few weeks, so the earlier the better.
